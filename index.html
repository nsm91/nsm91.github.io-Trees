				<h4>In the destructive wake of EAB (emerald ash borer), Burr Ridge was faced with removing over a fifth 
				of all parkway trees - exceeding two thousand ash trees. Back logged with removals and new plantings, their tree inventory 
				was facing obsoletion. Not only was I tasked with bringing the inventory up to current working order, but to 
				also create a system that would be easier to update and manage on a casual, day to day basis. As such, 
				I made the inventory compatible with a mobile app.
				<br>
				<br>
				This map was created specifically for use with the new (and still currently experimental) app QField®. 
				It's design is meant to be user friendly even for non-GIS personal and cartographically appealling 
				even on smartphone screen. Below are the methods I employed to acheive these goals.</h4>

                <p>Since the innitial view upon opening the app would be the entire village, I wanted this innitial rendering to be as 
				quick as possible. To facilitate this I used maximum geometry simplification for the parcels polygon layer. Additionally, 
				I made both the polyline street layer with actual attribute data and the polygon street layer with curb to curb geometry data 
				invisible at this scale. Likewise I do not have any labels visible at this extent, nor any historic trees that are no longer standing.

                <p>At zoomed in scales the parcels polygons no longer experience geometry simplifications. Additionally, the street 
				polygon layer is now rendered, allowing for accurate interpretations of right-of-way distances off the curb. 
				Underneath this polygon layer is the still invisible polyline street layer, but yet, the polyline labels do become visible. 
				These labels are the largest and are buffered so as to always stand out. Parcel labels 
				containing street addresses are visible at this scale too, however labels for tree species still are not. Note also that small red 
				dots are now visible, denoting historic locations for trees - important for inventory verification.

                <p>Since the actual tree data was the focus and driver of this entire project, it is only fitting that they 
				comprise the most robust portion of the map. As such I utilized three levels of rule based options (for styling, 
				rendering, and labeling) to deliver the information in the most immediately useful fashion possible. Only 
				currently standing trees would appear at full zoom, with the conventional symbol, and with a label. All historic trees 
				would only render at a zoomed in scale, as smaller and less pronounced red dots, and would do so without labels, unless user selected, 
				so as to not crowd the map.
