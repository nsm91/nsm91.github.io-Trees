				<h4>In the destructive wake of EAB (emerald ash borer), Burr Ridge was faced with removing over a fifth 
				of all parkway trees - exceeding two thousand ash trees. Back logged with removals and new plantings, their tree inventory 
				was facing obsoletion. I was tasked with bringing the inventory up to dateas well as creating 
				a system that would be easier to update and manage in the future. As such, 
				I wanted the inventory to be mobile and accessible outside the office.
				<br>
				<br>
				This inventory was created specifically for use with the new (and still currently experimental) app QFieldÂ® through QGIS. 
				It's design is meant to be user friendly even for non-GIS personal and cartographically appealling 
				even on a smartphone screen. Below is a recounting of some of the goals and their execution.</h4>

                <p>Since the innitial view upon opening the app would be the entire village, I wanted this innitial rendering to be as 
				quick as possible. To facilitate this I used maximum geometric simplification for the parcels polygon layer. 
				Only the parcels layer and the trees layer would be innitially visible. Labels are disabled until much 
				larger scales. I chose these two layer because together they gave an adequate sense of the village for 
				identifying a place of interest.

                <p>At zoomed in scales the parcels polygons no longer undergo geometric simplification. Additionally, polygons of 
				buildings, road pavement, and driveways now render, giving a less abstract sense of space. This 
				allows for more accurate interpretations of right-of-way distances from the curb. Underneath the 
				street polygon
				layer is the still invisible street polyline layer, with only their labels are visible. Parcel labels 
				containing street addresses are visible at this scale too.

                <p>Since the actual tree data was the focus and driver of the entire project, I used three levels of rule based options 
				(for styling, rendering, and labeling) to deliver the information in the most immediately useful fashion 
				possible. Only currently standing trees would appear at full zoom, with the conventional symbol, and 
				then at larger scales with a label. All historic trees would only render at a zoomed in scale, as smaller and less 
				pronounced red dots, and would do so without labels. Trees that need monitoring due to specific structural 
				flaws appear in a different color, as well as trees that are designated for removal.
